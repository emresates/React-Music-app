## Music App with React, Tailwind and RestAPI

### I knew about Tailwind, but I had never done a project before. It was a nice experience for me. In this project, which I did with the help of a video that appeared on Youtube, I designed a music application using React, RestAPI and Tailwind.

### When we first open the site, we are greeted by the discover page. In the top right there is a selection where we select a type of a music. If we click on the singer, the singer's other songs come up. If we click on the song, the lyrics of the song and similar songs appear. We can also search from the search bar at the top of the page.

### If we click on the photos the song starts to play but the api only allows us to play for 1.5 minutes.

### On the Around You page, it brings us songs that are popular according to our location. On the Top Artists page, we come across singers who have been listened to a lot in the world lately. On the top charts page, we see songs that have been listened to recently in the world.
